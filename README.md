## Password_Generator ##
SImple password generator created with Python

This script will keep generating the password till it meets the above requirement of having atleast one uppercase letter, one special character, one lowercase and one digit and all this is added while keeping the main rule of minimum length.

This script uses the "random" and "string" modules to generate a random password of the specified length.
The password will contain a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks. 
The "generate_password()" function takes one argument, which is the desired length of the password.
You can call this function with any length you want, and it will return a random password of that length but this code will check if the entered length of the password is less than 8. if yes, it will raise an error message 'Your password is weak. It should be at least 8 characters'. This is an example of raising a value error, which is a type of exception that indicates the function was called with an invalid argument.
If the entered length is greater than 8, it will generate the password of that length
The "string.ascii_letters" is a concatenation of the ascii_lowercase and ascii_uppercase constants. This is a string containing all letters.
The "string.digits" is a string containing all the digits.
The "string.punctuation" is a string containing all the ASCII punctuation characters.

The "import" statement in Python is used to include a module in a program. In this case, the import random statement is used to include the random module in the program.
The "random" module is a built-in Python module that provides a suite of functions to generate random numbers and data. Some of the commonly used functions of the random module are:

- random.random(): Generates a random float between 0 and 1.
- random.randint(a, b): Generates a random integer between a and b, inclusive.
- random.randrange(start, stop, step): Generates a random number from the range specified by start, stop, and step.
- random.choice(sequence): Chooses a random element from a non-empty sequence.
- random.shuffle(sequence): Shuffles elements in a sequence in place.

In the script provided, we are using "random.choice()" function to randomly select a character from the list of characters that is created by concatenating "string.ascii_letters", "string.digits" and "string.punctuation". And using a loop to generate the password with the required characters, while fulfilling the additional rules (uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digits and punctuation) if provided in the code.

By importing the random module, all of its functions and variables are made available in the program, so that they can be used in the script without having to write the code to generate random numbers or data from scratch.

The "import string" statement in Python is used to include the string module in the program. The string module is a built-in Python module that provides various string constants and classes. Some of the commonly used constants of the string module are:

- string.ascii_letters: A string containing all letters (both uppercase and lowercase).
- string.ascii_lowercase: A string containing all lowercase letters.
- string.ascii_uppercase: A string containing all uppercase letters.
- string.digits: A string containing all digits.
- string.hexdigits: A string containing all hexadecimal digits.
- string.octdigits: A string containing all octal digits.
- string.punctuation: A string containing all ASCII punctuation characters.
- string.printable: A string containing all printable ASCII characters.

In the script provided, we are using "string.ascii_letters" , "string.digits" and "string.punctuation" to create the pool of characters to select from while generating the password. And since these are string constants defined in the module. we need to import the module to use these constants.

By importing the "string" module, all of its constants and classes are made available in the program, so that they can be used in the script without having to re-write the code.
